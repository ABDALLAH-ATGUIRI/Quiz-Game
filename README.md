# Quiz-Game
The student takes the test by answering each question presented to him one at a time. Once a
question is answered he clicks next to receive the next question. When there are no more
questions to answer, the student clicks a button to submit his answers.
Once the quiz is submitted, the system shows the student the results with the correct answers.
